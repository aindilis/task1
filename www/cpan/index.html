  <h3>WARNING: The FRDCSA is extremely alpha.</h3>
  <p>
    This code is being released with the hope that it will be of some
    use but hopefully interest other developers to help accomplish a
    complete release of all the usable code within the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code is littered with problems.  First, at the last second,
    all the modules have been prefixed with the "FRDCSA" namespace in
    order to make them easily distinguished in CPAN.  This has
    probably broken some parts including those that do "require" and
    similar things from strings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code is full of Debian-only commands, Linux-only syntax, hard
    coded file references, references to files which won't exist, and
    so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much work remains to get it into shape.  While the modules
    themselves are poorly written, it has always been desired to make
    something similar to Perl::Critic using PPI in order to
    semi-automatically refactor the code to fix most surface
    inadequacies.
