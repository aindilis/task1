We could test that the eval $c problem was due to it returning the
last item rather than $VAR1 and we could make a work around and then
reprogram everything the proper way.

We could write software to untangle the dependencies by finding
commonly used modules and splitting them off to their own
distribution.

We could adapt the code so that it can be used by packager to package
perl programs like Koha for Debian.

We could have it generate .tgz files and install scripts so that
people who are not using debian can use it.

Put up the software on sourceforge and freshmeat.

Put task1 into svn.

Get rid of the enormous directories.

Make data packages as well.

When outputing the debian install files, be sure to not just put the
root ones but each individual module since some modules may belong to
different distributions (i.e. usually their own).
